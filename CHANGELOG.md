## [v1.1.0] - 25 February 2024

### Breaking Changes

-   The default render engine is now [resvg-js](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js).
    To use Puppeteer, either assign the `--puppeteer` option in the command line or set `"use": "puppeteer"` in the JSON config.

    **Example in CLI Argument:**

    ```bash
    npx cbmp -d svg -o out --puppeteer
    ```

    **In config files:**

    ```json
    {
        "use": "puppeteer",
        "Sample 1": {
            "dir": "svg",
            "out": "out/sample1"
        },

        "Sample 2": {
            "dir": "svg",
            "out": "out/sample2",
            "fps": 10
        }
    }
    ```
